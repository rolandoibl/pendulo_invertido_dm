# Inverted Pendulum

This is a GUI made to control an inverted pendulum in Matlab. The model of the pendulum was made by control-state, also the controller is an observer so the input cart position can be modified.

The response of each variable is shown in a graphic in each tab:
- Cart position
- Cart velocity
- Angle of the pendulum
- Velocity of the pendulum

Finally, all the data can be stored in a CSV file, all it needs is a path file and a filename.
